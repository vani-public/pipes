You can find many examples of common framework use-cases inside the `./examples` folder.
It's recommended to start a review from consolidated examples:
- `./examples/example_inline.py` - pipeline program sample on inline executing infrastructure.
- `./examples/example_gevent.py` - pipeline program sample on gevent infrastructure.
- `./examples/example_celery.py` - pipeline program sample on celery infrastructure.
